You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a mobile app. You will be given app-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.

Here's the information you'll have:
The TASK: This is the task you're trying to complete.
The OBSERVATION: This is a simplified representation of the UI screen, providing key information.
The PREVIOUS ACTION: This is the action you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.

The actions you can perform fall into several categories:

Touch Screen Actions:
`click [index]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific index.
`longclick [index]`: This action long clicks on an element with a specific index.
`text [index] [content]`: Use this to type the content into the field with index.
`swipe [index] [direction=down|up|left|right]`: swipe an element with a specific index in a specific direction.


Global Navigation Actions:
`press [back]`: Press back button.
`press [restart]`: Press to restart the app.
`press [home]`:  Press to return to the desktop.
`press [none]`: Do nothing but wait for the UI page completely loaded.
`press [stop]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete.
`press [enter]`: Press the "Enter" key.

To be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation
2. You should only issue one action at a time.
3. You should reason step by step and then issue the next action.
4. Generate the action in the correct format. After step-by-step reasoning, summary with a "In summary, the next action I will perform is" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, "In summary, the next action I will perform is ```text [12] [some text]```".
5. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the task. Don't generate anything after stop.

TASK: view Saturday's weather
PREVIOUS ACTION: None
==================== llm output begin ====================
To view Saturday's weather, I need to navigate to the section of the app where the weather information is displayed. Currently, the observation shows that I am in a settings menu, which is not where the weather information is located.

==================== llm output begin ====================
To accomplish the task of viewing Saturday's weather, I need to navigate through the app to find the weather section. Currently, the observation shows that I am on a screen with advertisements. The task requires me to view specific information about Saturday's weather, which is likely not on the current screen filled with ads.

1. The current screen is dominated by advertisements, and there is no direct indication of weather information.
2. There are multiple clickable elements with the description "to close the advertisement." Clicking one of these might help in removing the ad overlay and revealing the main content of the app, which could include weather information.
3. The previous action was clicking on an element to close an advertisement, but it seems the ad is still present.
4. I will attempt to close the advertisement by clicking on another element with the description "to close the advertisement."

In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [6]```.

To accomplish the task of viewing Saturday's weather, I need to navigate through the app to find the weather forecast for Saturday. Currently, I am on a permission request screen asking if the app can use my location. Allowing location access might be necessary to get accurate weather information.

Given the options available:
- [0] DO NOT ALLOW
- [1] ALLOW

Since I need to view the weather, it is logical to allow the app to use my location to provide accurate weather data. Therefore, I should click on the "ALLOW" button.

Given that the list of days is scrollable, I should attempt to scroll through the list to find Saturday. The `RecyclerView` with index [12] contains the days of the week, so I will perform a scroll action on this element to reveal more days.

TASK: view Saturday's weather
PREVIOUS ACTION: Swipe on a RecyclerView (resource_id: rvDay; text: 100% 84% 0% 0% 0% 100% ; actions: clickable; ) in left direction.
==================== llm output begin ====================
To view Saturday's weather, I need to locate and interact with the element that corresponds to Saturday. In the current observation, I can see that there is a TextView with the text "SAT" and an index of [10]. This element is clickable, which suggests that clicking it will display the weather details for Saturday.

In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [10]```.
==================== llm end ====================
Parsed Action: ```click [10]```.

==================== llm input begin ====================
You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a mobile app. You will be given app-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.

Here's the information you'll have:
The TASK: This is the task you're trying to complete.
The OBSERVATION: This is a simplified representation of the UI screen, providing key information.
The PREVIOUS ACTION: This is the action you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.

The actions you can perform fall into several categories:

Touch Screen Actions:
`click [index]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific index.
`longclick [index]`: This action long clicks on an element with a specific index.
`text [index] [content]`: Use this to type the content into the field with index.
`swipe [index] [direction=down|up|left|right]`: swipe an element with a specific index in a specific direction.


Global Navigation Actions:
`press [back]`: Press back button.
`press [restart]`: Press to restart the app.
`press [home]`:  Press to return to the desktop.
`press [none]`: Do nothing but wait for the UI page completely loaded.
`press [stop]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete.
`press [enter]`: Press the "Enter" key.

To be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:
1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation
2. You should only issue one action at a time.
3. You should reason step by step and then issue the next action.
4. Generate the action in the correct format. After step-by-step reasoning, summary with a "In summary, the next action I will perform is" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, "In summary, the next action I will perform is ```text [12] [some text]```".
5. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the task. Don't generate anything after stop.

TASK: view Saturday's weather
PREVIOUS ACTION: Click on a TextView (resource_id: tv_day_of_week; text: SAT ; actions: clickable; ).
==================== llm output begin ====================
To view Saturday's weather, I need to ensure that the correct element is selected. The previous action indicates that I clicked on the TextView representing Saturday. Now, I should check if the weather details for Saturday are displayed. However, the current observation does not provide explicit confirmation that the weather details for Saturday are shown. 

Given the structure of the UI, it seems likely that clicking on the "SAT" TextView should have updated the weather details displayed in the `RecyclerView` with resource_id `rvDay`. Since there is no indication of a need for further interaction to view Saturday's weather, it is reasonable to conclude that the task is complete.

In summary, the next action I will perform is ```press [stop]```.
==================== llm end ====================
Parsed Action: ```press [stop]```.
